# Machine Learning Paper Reviews
To prepare for the incoming master thesis project and the research work at laboratory, bunch of machine learning papers would be my daily reading material in next stage. I will write down summaries about all the papers I read and elaborate my ideas (if any) . Since my current work and master thesis mainly focus on the online learning optimization problem, section \ref{sec:optimization} might be the most important part in this document. 

To compile the LaTex project with correct bibliography, please use:
