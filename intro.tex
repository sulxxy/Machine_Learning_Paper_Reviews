To prepare for the incoming master thesis project and the research work at laboratory, bunch of machine learning papers would be my daily reading material in next stage. 
I will write down summaries (following the rule \textit{one page per paper}) about all the papers I read and elaborate my ideas (if any). 
Since my current work and master thesis mainly focus on the online learning optimization problem, section \ref{sec:optimization} might be the most important part in this document. 

Besides this, section \ref{sec:deep_learning} focuses on the deep learning area. Section \ref{sec:reinforcement_learning} takes notes regarding (deep) reinforcement learning, which is a promising sub field of machine learning. Section \ref{sec:nlp} and \ref{sec:cv} summarize the papers in the field of natural language processing and computer vision.
