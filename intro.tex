To prepare for the incoming master thesis project and the research work at laboratory, bunch of machine learning papers would be my daily reading material in next stage. 
I will write down ideas and summaries (about one page per paper) about all the papers I read and elaborate my ideas (if any). 
Since my current work and master thesis mainly focus on the online learning optimization problems, the topic of optimization shall be the most important part in this document.

this report is divided into 4 main parts, and the structure is shown as below. 
Chapter \ref{sec:introduction_materials} lists some introductory materials about the optimization theory.
Chapter \ref{sec:online_convex_optimization} focuses on online convex optimization problems. 
Chapter \ref{sec:non-convex_optimization} mainly talks about non-convex optimization problems. 
At the end, some other supplementary reading materials are discussed in chapter \ref{sec:supplementary_materials}.
