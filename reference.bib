abstract = {We present tools for the analysis of Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (FTRL), Dual Averaging, and Mirror Descent algorithms when the regularizer (equivalently, prox-function or learning rate schedule) is chosen adaptively based on the data. Adaptivity can be used to prove regret bounds that hold on every round, and also allows for data-dependent regret bounds as in AdaGrad-style algorithms (e.g., Online Gradient Descent with adaptive per-coordinate learning rates). We present results from a large number of prior works in a unified manner, using a modular and tight analysis that isolates the key arguments in easily re-usable lemmas. This approach strengthens pre-viously known FTRL analysis techniques to produce bounds as tight as those achieved by potential functions or primal-dual analysis. Further, we prove a general and exact equivalence between an arbitrary adaptive Mirror Descent algorithm and a correspond- ing FTRL update, which allows us to analyze any Mirror Descent algorithm in the same framework. The key to bridging the gap between Dual Averaging and Mirror Descent algorithms lies in an analysis of the FTRL-Proximal algorithm family. Our regret bounds are proved in the most general form, holding for arbitrary norms and non-smooth regularizers with time-varying weight.},

abstract = {In the recent years, a number of parameter-free algorithms have been developed for online linear optimization over Hilbert spaces and for learning with expert advice. These algorithms achieve optimal regret bounds that depend on the unknown competitors, without having to tune the learning rates with oracle choices. We present a new intuitive framework to design parameter-free algorithms for $\backslash$emph{\{}both{\}} online linear optimization over Hilbert spaces and for learning with expert advice, based on reductions to betting on outcomes of adversarial coins. We instantiate it using a betting algorithm based on the Krichevsky-Trofimov estimator. The resulting algorithms are simple, with no parameters to be tuned, and they improve or match previous results in terms of regret guarantee and per-round complexity.},

abstract = {We propose an online convex optimization algorithm (RescaledExp) that achieves optimal regret in the unconstrained setting without prior knowledge of any bounds on the loss functions. We prove a lower bound showing an exponential separation between the regret of existing algorithms that require a known bound on the loss functions and any algorithm that does not require such knowledge. RescaledExp matches this lower bound asymptotically in the number of iterations. RescaledExp is naturally hyperparameter-free and we demonstrate empirically that it matches prior optimization algorithms that require hyperparameter optimization.},

@article{McMahan2013,
abstract = {We design and analyze minimax-optimal algorithms for online linear optimization games where the player's choice is unconstrained. The player strives to minimize regret, the difference between his loss and the loss of a post-hoc benchmark strategy. The standard benchmark is the loss of the best strategy chosen from a bounded comparator set. When the the comparison set and the adversary's gradients satisfy L{\_}infinity bounds, we give the value of the game in closed form and prove it approaches sqrt(2T/pi) as T -{\textgreater} infinity. Interesting algorithms result when we consider soft constraints on the comparator, rather than restricting it to a bounded set. As a warmup, we analyze the game with a quadratic penalty. The value of this game is exactly T/2, and this value is achieved by perhaps the simplest online algorithm of all: unprojected gradient descent with a constant learning rate. We then derive a minimax-optimal algorithm for a much softer penalty function. This algorithm achieves good bounds under the standard notion of regret for any comparator point, without needing to specify the comparator set in advance. The value of this game converges to sqrt{\{}e{\}} as T -{\textgreater}infinity; we give a closed-form for the exact value as a function of T. The resulting algorithm is natural in unconstrained investment or betting scenarios, since it guarantees at worst constant loss, while allowing for exponential reward against an "easy" adversary.},

@article{Orabona2017,
abstract = {Deep learning methods achieve state-of-the-art performance in many application scenarios. Yet, these methods require a significant amount of hyperparameters tuning in order to achieve the best results. In particular, tuning the learning rates in the stochastic optimization process is still one of the main bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose a new stochastic gradient descent procedure for deep networks that does not require any learning rate setting. Contrary to previous methods, we do not adapt the learning rates nor we make use of the assumed curvature of the objective function. Instead, we reduce the optimization process to a game of betting on a coin and propose a learning-rate-free optimal algorithm for this scenario. Theoretical convergence is proven for convex and quasi-convex functions and empirical evidence shows the advantage of our algorithm over popular stochastic gradient algorithms.},

@article{Hazan2015,
abstract = {The graduated optimization approach, also known as the continuation method, is a popular heuristic to solving non-convex problems that has received renewed interest over the last decade. Despite its popularity, very little is known in terms of theoretical convergence analysis. In this paper we describe a new first-order algorithm based on graduated optimiza- tion and analyze its performance. We characterize a parameterized family of non- convex functions for which this algorithm provably converges to a global optimum. In particular, we prove that the algorithm converges to an {\{}$\backslash$epsilon{\}}-approximate solution within O(1/$\backslash$epsilon{\^{}}2) gradient-based steps. We extend our algorithm and analysis to the setting of stochastic non-convex optimization with noisy gradient feedback, attaining the same convergence rate. Additionally, we discuss the setting of zero-order optimization, and devise a a variant of our algorithm which converges at rate of O(d{\^{}}2/$\backslash$epsilon{\^{}}4).},

Furthermore, we show strong optimality of the algorithm. Finally, we provide an extension of our results to general norms.},
